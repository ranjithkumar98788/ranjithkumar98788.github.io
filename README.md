# 1. Before You Begin
Try to answer the question, "Why does this codelab exist?" This should be one sentence.
## Prerequisites
To perform this codelab, you must have:

A Google email address (either your GVSU Google email account or a personal Gmail account.
A Google Cloud coupon sent by the instructor (or, if you are not from GVSU, a free-tier Google Cloud account).

## What You'll Do
1. Create a Google Cloud account
2. Setup a billing account and project
3. Create a free-tier virtual machine that you can always leave on

## What you'll need
Up-to-date browser
Working internet connection

## Note!
All cloud providers have a tendency of updating their interface ... often! If what you see doesn't match my screenshots exactly feel free to click around and explore - they should be at least similar.
